              3. Data Protection & Security
            </h4>
            <p>Koi employs industry-standard security protocols to protect user data, including:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
              <li>
                Blockchain Transparency: Transactions are securely processed on-chain, eliminating
                centralized control over funds.
              </li>
              <li>
                Encryption & Secure Storage: Any personal data stored off-chain is encrypted and
                protected against unauthorized access.

                Account & Wallet Security: Users are responsible for safeguarding their wallet

            </ul>
            <p>
              While we take reasonable precautions to protect user data, blockchain transactions are
              inherently irreversible, and Koi is not responsible for lost funds due to compromised
              wallets, phishing attacks, or user negligence.
