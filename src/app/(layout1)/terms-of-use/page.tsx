              Newer headsets like the Meta Quest 2 and Pico 4 are significantly lighter than earlier
              models, reducing neck strain and fatigue during longer sessions. Adjustable head
              straps, facial interfaces, and weight distribution techniques make VR headsets fit
              snugly and comfortably on a wider range of head shapes and sizes. Some headsets
              incorporate built-in fans or removable faceplates to improve airflow and prevent
              sweating, making them more hygienic for shared use. Standalone headsets like the Quest
              2 eliminate the need for tethered connections to PCs, offering greater freedom of
              movement and reducing cable snags. Advancements in haptic technology are bringing
              touch sensations to VR experiences, adding to immersion and potentially reducing
              reliance on visual cues for interaction. Systems using external sensors or specialized
              suits are enabling full-body movement tracking in VR, opening up possibilities for
              more natural and immersive interactions. Some headsets are blurring the lines between
              VR and AR, offering the ability to overlay virtual elements onto the real world,
              potentially improving wearability and comfort by not completely blocking your
              surroundings. Overall, VR wearability is improving along with affordability and these
              two key factors are interdependently evolving through the various investment fuelling
              inventions in this space. And with ongoing advancements in technology and design, the
              future of comfortable and immersive VR is looking bright and this ensures, that
              technology is inevitable and whoever catches this trend and builds values in a niche
              market takes the first mover advantage, as the investments in this market are
              undeniably promising to the investors hunting for high return portfolios.
