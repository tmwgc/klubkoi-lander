            Players who acquire Virtual Real Estate (VRE), such as Lounges, VIP Suites, and
            Hideaways, establish ownership within the digital Koi ecosystem. Owners of exclusive
            spaces are rewarded with daily drops of in-game features (such as cheats or access
            cards) which can be sold or used to further the Player&#39;s objectives within the game.

          <br />
          <p>
            The next objective? Achieve High Roller status. High Rollers gain access to the
            exclusive High Roller Staking Pool, earning a share of platform revenue generated across
            all casino applications, in-game sales, and marketing streams. The more you play, the
            more you stake, and the more you earnâ€”staking your claim as a true VIP in the Koi
            ecosystem.
